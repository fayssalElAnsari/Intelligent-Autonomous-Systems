## Tasks

# Robotics Coursework To-Do List

### khepera

- [x] **Simulator and IDE Setup**: After installing the simulator and its IDE, go through the example of implementing the Khepera III robot to ensure everything is operational.

- [x] **Straight Line Movement and Stop Implementation**: From your previous coursework, implement the movement of your robot in a straight line and program it to stop in front of the first encountered obstacle.

- [x] **Algorithm Implementation with Proximity Sensors**: With the Webots simulator using the Khepera III robot, implement the algorithm using all of the robot's proximity sensors. Choose the correct weights to ensure satisfactory behavior of the robot.

- [x] **Neural Network for Obstacle Avoidance**: How would you implement a neural network for obstacle avoidance based on Braitenberg's approach for the Alphabot2? Plan and outline the implementation.

- [~] **Obstacle Contour Following Algorithm for Khepera III**: What algorithm would you implement for contour following of obstacles on the right side with the Khepera III? Implement and test this.

### AlphaBot2

- [x] **Straight Line Movement and Stop Implementation**: From your previous coursework, implement the movement of your robot in a straight line and program it to stop in front of the first encountered obstacle.

- [ ] **Finite State Machine for Obstacle Avoidance**: If you had to provide an obstacle avoidance algorithm for the Alphabot2 using a finite state machine, what would it look like? Implement and test this.

- [ ] **Line Following with Alphabot2 Sensors**: If you were to implement line following using the sensors of the Alphabot2, what algorithm would you propose? Implement and test your idea.

## TD1 AoC Questions Submission Guidelines

The expected submission for the TD1 of AoC should include:

- **Explanations** in the `README.doc` document.
- Writing code in the **Khepera Simulator** under Webots, including a **demonstration video**.
- Writing code for the **Alphabot robot**, accompanied by a **demonstration video**.

Refer to the `Carte du rendu AoC` Excel document for detailed instructions on the submission elements.
